Project Description

I am currently working on an exciting project aimed at optimizing urban traffic flow through data-driven streetlight timing. Using comprehensive traffic data from a city, my goal is to create a machine learning model that can recommend optimal adjustments to city streetlight timings. By leveraging traffic patterns, congestion levels, and historical data, this model seeks to enhance traffic efficiency, reduce congestion, and improve the overall commuting experience within urban areas.

Future Goals

Once completed, this project has the potential to make a significant impact on city traffic infrastructure. My intention is to showcase the model's effectiveness to local governments and transportation authorities, advocating for its integration into real-world traffic management systems. By implementing data-driven streetlight timing adjustments, cities can not only reduce travel times and greenhouse gas emissions but also enhance road safety and promote a smoother flow of traffic for the benefit of their residents and commuters. This project represents a step towards smarter, more efficient, and eco-friendly urban transportation systems.
